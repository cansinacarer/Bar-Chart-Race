## Health Care Spending in OECD Countries
### As the Percentage of GDP Between 1970 and 2017
Data: [OECD](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=HEALTH_STAT#), Visualization: [Cansin Cagan Acarer](https://cacarer.com/)

I originally created this visualization in JavaScript [link](https://observablehq.com/@cansin/health-care-spending-in-oecd-countries). I recreated it here in Python as a learning exercise.

Please see the [notebook file](https://github.com/cansinacarer/Bar-Chart-Race/blob/main/health-care-spending-in-oecd-countries.ipynb) for how this bar chart race is created.
